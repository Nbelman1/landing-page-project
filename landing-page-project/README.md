#The Capstone Project - Landing Page

We made it boys! Out of the flexbox exercises and into the project.  

The goal of the project is to build a webpage. I'm not looking for full-fledged functionality - rather
just the passable design of a landing page. It will be done completely from scratch. 
Hopefully, this will show off my skills with HTML and CSS as they relate to web design, particularly flexbox. 

Without further adieu, let's get it.
